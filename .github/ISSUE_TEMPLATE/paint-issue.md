* **PTHR ID & PTN node:**

* **Sequences with problematic annotation (ID + gene/protein name):**

* **Type of Issue: Erroneous source or erroneous propagation, or other issue**

* Add the label 'high priority' if needed. Generally high priority issues affect a lot of proteins, and annotations are incorrect (as opposed to just imprecise).
